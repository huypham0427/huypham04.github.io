    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am <strong>Huy Pham</strong>
      <br> My major is Computer Science and I am learning Web Development to build up my skills.
      <br> Besides coding, my favorite sport is Badminton. It is not popular in the US, so I attached its information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton">Badminton</a>
      <br> If you want to play this sport, all your need are the racket and the shuttlecock. 
      <br> This is <strong> my dream racket </strong>. It's a ARCSABER 11 PRO - will be launched at the end of Feb 2022
